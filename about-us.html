	<h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="text">
      <p><strong>Epiph-a-ny</strong><br>
        <em>Pronunciation: ih-pif-uh-nee<br>
        Function: noun</em><br>
        1. an illuminating discovery<br>
		2. revealing scene or moment </p>
      <p>In 1976, The United States Arabian  National Championships came to Louisville, Kentucky for the first time. Duane's  family had Arabian horses and felt that Nationals, being so close, presented an  opportunity that should be enjoyed by the entire family.</p>
      <p>That show in Freedom Hall became a  defining moment for Duane, his epiphany &quot;I looked at those horses, better  horses than I had ever seen in my life, and I was awe struck. That was when I knew that I wanted to become  a true horseman.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>Duane came home, took a serious look  at the family's horses, gave them all baths and developed a plan for training.  Two years later, Duane, at age 18 won the Region 14 Open English Pleasure  Championship on a horse his parents owned and he had trained. The significance  of the accomplishment was magnified, when his brother Joe, won the Region 14  Open Western Pleasure Championship. Winning over professionals was not  necessarily the goal, but it made Duane realize that this talent could and  would be his life's work.</p>
      <p>While Duane attended college, his  involvement with horses continued to evolve.  As his parents obtained more horses, Gene LaCroix became a trusted advisor to the family,  providing guidance on the art of evaluating horses to purchase and key points  on determining the discipline for each horse.  Selecting the correct discipline for each horse is critical to creating  an environment where both horse and rider can feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>
      <p>EVA&rsquo;s breeding program was started in  1977 by Duane&rsquo;s parents, with a goal of producing horses that are very  athletic, and contain both the unique beauty and Type of the Arabian  breed. Very close attention is also  given to producing horses with a harmonious disposition, which when combined  with trainability is vital for success.  Our program has proven to be a study and collection of some of the most  treasured Arabian bloodlines in the world, including *Bask, El Ghazi, Afire Bey  V and Huckleberry Bey++, among others.</p>
      <p>A large percentage of EVA bred horses  have achieved numerous wins, at both regional and national levels, in many  different divisions. However, whether  you are interested in purchasing a future champion or searching for a family  horse, you will find a selection for your consideration at Esser Valley.</p>
      <p>In addition to maintaining his breeding  and training programs full time, Duane is very active in many areas of the  equestrian industry. He is currently  serving, or has served, as Region 14 Vice Director, as a member of the USEF  Hearing Committee, the Executive Board of National Show Horse Registry, and  chairs the Judges and Stewards Steering Committee of the AHA. Also, Duane preserves his association with  grass roots organizations by serving as president of KARABS, the Kentucky  Arabian Rider and Breeders Society.</p>
      <p>Duane is also proud to serve as a  judge, at both Regional/National level shows as well in the international  arena. He enjoys judging, and takes the  responsibility very seriously. &quot;I was fortunate enough to adjudicate in  South Africa and the experience was unforgettable. I&rsquo;ve also judged Canadian Nationals;  it was thrilling to stand in center ring at such a prestigious show.&quot;</p>
